# Welcome to BELLSight!

This is an OpenSource project of a blockchain explorer for BELLSCOIN, which currently only uses the NINTONDO PUBLIC API and the COINGECKO PUBLIC API to collect and display data. 

Only limitation at the moment is that itÂ´s not possible to fetch tx related to addresses or blocks and to fetch the latest tx.
This will be implemented in future updates in some way.

# Usage

You can search for:
- block height
- block hash
- tx hash
- address
- (tokens will be implemented in the future)
